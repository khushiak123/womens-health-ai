# Women's Health AI Assistant 🌸

## Health & Wellness Theme

### 🏥 Problem Statement
Women have diverse health needs that are often not adequately addressed by generic healthcare approaches. This lack of personalization can lead to suboptimal health outcomes and limited access to relevant services.

### 🔍 Challenge
Develop a data-driven solution using **Hierarchical Clustering** and **Gaussian Mixture Models** to segment women based on their health needs and preferences, aiming to create personalized healthcare recommendations.

### 🚀 Futuristic Solution
Use advanced clustering algorithms to segment women by health needs and preferences, enabling personalized healthcare recommendations that enhance service access, improve outcomes, and adapt to evolving health trends through machine learning.
